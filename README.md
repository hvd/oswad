To use this , you need to provide a path to a
spam corpus, a non-spam corpus and a test corpus.
To get best results use normalized data, ie data
containing only words stripped of all html 
and headers.
The output will be the probability of a test set being 
either spam or non-spam based upon which a classification decision can be made.
There is a plan to add normalizing capabilities in addition to automating the
classification going forward.
